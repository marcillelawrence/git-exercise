### Reasons for Writing a README File

1. A good README helps your project to stand out from other projects and should be as good as your project itself.
2. It’s the first thing to notice while encountering your project, so it should be pretty brief but detailed.
3. The quality of a README description differentiates a good project from bad ones.
4. Many times README.md is hosted as a website; make sure your webpage looks as cool as your project!


### Contents of Readme File:

* **Include Your Project Title:** This is the name of the project. It describes the whole project in few words and helps people understand the primary goal and aim.
* **Write a Description:** Your description is an essential part of your project. A well-maintained description allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers.
* **How to Use  Your  Project:** Provide instructions and examples so that users or contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them so that if they encounter a problem, they will always have a place of reference.
* **Include Credits:** If you have worked on the project as a team, list your team members. You should also include their GitHub profiles. 


### *You can also add the following details in the Readme file:*

1. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project?
2. What problem does the project solve? Or, what it does?
3. Why you used specific technologies? If your project has a lot of many features, list them here.
4. Mention some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.
5. Mention anything that you think you are proud of building or having in that project.
6. What did you learn in the process?
7. What’s next for the project?
8. Mention languages, frameworks, databases, etc.
9. Provide deploy links or any other required links.
